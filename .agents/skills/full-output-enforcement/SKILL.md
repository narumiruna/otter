## Otter Technology Stack

These repository-specific rules take priority over generic implementation examples below.
For image-only tasks, use them as design constraints without generating code or installing packages.
Keep the requested visual direction, but preserve existing product behavior, localization, accessibility, and theme preferences.

- **Browser app:** Use strict TypeScript and React with Vite in `apps/web`.
Do not introduce Next.js, React Server Components, `"use client"`, or native app frameworks.
- **Components:** Use `@radix-ui/themes` first and the installed `radix-ui` Primitives for behavior not covered by Themes.
Do not introduce shadcn/ui or another component system.
- **Styling:** Use existing CSS and Tailwind CSS v4 through `@tailwindcss/vite`.
Map colors through `@radix-ui/colors` and existing semantic tokens in `apps/web/src/client/index.css`.
Preserve `RadixTheme` in `apps/web/src/client/radix-theme.tsx` as the theme owner.
Treat palette examples below as visual references, not hard-coded product colors.
- **Icons and fonts:** Use `@radix-ui/react-icons` and the installed `@fontsource-variable/geist` with existing language fallbacks.
Keep Radix Icons at consistent sizes; do not force unsupported stroke-width or weight props.
Other font examples are references, not instructions to install or assume fonts.
- **State and forms:** Reuse `@tanstack/react-query` for server state and `react-hook-form` for forms where applicable.
Use React state or existing context for local UI state; do not add a state library.
- **Motion:** Prefer CSS transitions and keyframes for meaningful feedback.
Use `IntersectionObserver` only when viewport detection is needed, with effect cleanup.
Honor `prefers-reduced-motion`; do not require perpetual animation or add Motion, Framer Motion, GSAP, or Three.js for visual polish.
- **API and domain:** Keep Hono and PostgreSQL (`pg`) in `apps/api`, raw SQL migrations in `apps/api/db/migrations`, domain rules in `packages/core`, and HTTP DTOs and guards in `packages/contracts`.
Preserve `apps/* -> packages/*`; web and CLI must not import API implementation files.
- **Dependencies and checks:** Read the root and target workspace `package.json` before imports.
Use npm workspaces from the repository root; do not install packages for hypothetical needs.
Use Biome, Vitest, Testing Library, and Playwright.
Run `npm run check` for implementation changes and report unavailable checks.
Browser E2E tests require a migrated `DATABASE_URL` and installed Chromium.

# Full-Output Enforcement

## Baseline

Treat every task as production-critical. A partial output is a broken output. Do not optimize for brevity — optimize for completeness. If the user asks for a full file, deliver the full file. If the user asks for 5 components, deliver 5 components. No exceptions.

## Banned Output Patterns

The following patterns are hard failures. Never produce them:

**In code blocks:** `// ...`, `// rest of code`, `// implement here`, `// TODO`, `/* ... */`, `// similar to above`, `// continue pattern`, `// add more as needed`, bare `...` standing in for omitted code

**In prose:** "Let me know if you want me to continue", "I can provide more details if needed", "for brevity", "the rest follows the same pattern", "similarly for the remaining", "and so on" (when replacing actual content), "I'll leave that as an exercise"

**Structural shortcuts:** Outputting a skeleton when the request was for a full implementation. Showing the first and last section while skipping the middle. Replacing repeated logic with one example and a description. Describing what code should do instead of writing it.

## Execution Process

1. **Scope** — Read the full request. Count how many distinct deliverables are expected (files, functions, sections, answers). Lock that number.
2. **Build** — Generate every deliverable completely. No partial drafts, no "you can extend this later."
3. **Cross-check** — Before output, re-read the original request. Compare your deliverable count against the scope count. If anything is missing, add it before responding.

## Handling Long Outputs

When a response approaches the token limit:

- Do not compress remaining sections to squeeze them in.
- Do not skip ahead to a conclusion.
- Write at full quality up to a clean breakpoint (end of a function, end of a file, end of a section).
- End with:

```
[PAUSED — X of Y complete. Send "continue" to resume from: next section name]
```

On "continue", pick up exactly where you stopped. No recap, no repetition.

## Quick Check

Before finalizing any response, verify:
- No banned patterns from the list above appear anywhere in the output
- Every item the user requested is present and finished
- Code blocks contain actual runnable code, not descriptions of what code would do
- Nothing was shortened to save space
