## Current PM candidate ranking

| Rank | Candidate | User impact | Correctness | Reliability | Dev speed | Maintainability | Verification clarity | Effort | Risk | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Edit expense currency | Medium | High | Medium | Medium | Medium | High | Medium | Medium | Completed this cycle: fixes wrong currency choices now that amount/date/payer/split edits exist. |
| 2 | Add participant merge flow | Medium | High | Medium | Low | Medium | Low | High | High | Next likely user-facing candidate, but risky because it rewrites expense ownership. |
| 3 | Add basic print stylesheet | Low | Low | High | High | High | Low | Low | Low | Later: low impact compared with data export. |
| 4 | Add recurring expense templates | Medium | Medium | Medium | Low | Medium | Low | High | Medium | Later: speculative until repeated-entry pain is clear. |
| 5 | Add trip archive flag | Low | Low | Medium | Medium | High | Medium | Medium | Low | Later: housekeeping after core correction flows. |
